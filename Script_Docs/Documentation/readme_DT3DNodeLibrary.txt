Info: =============================================================================== 

This is a Mari procedural nodelibrary that adds new procedural types like Cellular, Gabor, 
Perlin, Value, Simplex, Brownian, Turbulence, Inigo Multi-Fractal, Ridged Fractal noise and 
more planned for the future.

Requirements: =======================================================================

- Mari 2.5 or above
- MARI Function Library 1.06.005 or above

Installation: =======================================================================

Take scripts and put them into your user preference script directory. Or any startup
script path that Mari has set. Once these are in place, Mari on startup will run through
the scripts folder and load the procedural library. Going to the Python tab and showing
the console will allow you to see the modules loading up. This is where if in any case
the loading fails it will let you know. 

Example:
	• On Linux: /Mari/Scripts/
	• On Windows: Documents/Mari/Scripts/

Where to find the nodes: ============================================================

The new nodes are located under the /Procedurals/Custom/ 
Paintable Gabor Node is located under /Adjustments/Custom/
